# sonos
This library makes interfacing an Arduino with your Sonos system a breeze. The library supports both controlling and reading the state of your Sonos components.  Playing URIs, files, online radio stations, playlists, and line-in is supported as well as the most common commands like play, pause, skip, mute, volume and speaker grouping.  What sets this library apart from similar libraries written for the Arduino platform it its ability to read the state of most of the Sonos functions: getting source, player state, track number, track position, volume and more. The library is relatively compact and has a small enough memory footprint to run on the Arduino Uno and Duemilanove.
